Diversify
=======
[Diversify](http://diversify-project.eu/) is an EU FP7 project, that aims at 
leveraging diversity, to improve software systems. An inter-disciplinary 
effort, one of our partners is the ECOBIO[^1] group
 from the [Université de Rennes 1](http://www.univ-rennes1.fr/english/). The 
intent is that knowledge, concepts, and techniques flow in a two-way stream, 
between ecology and computer science. The full list of partners is as follows:

* [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr/en/centre/rennes)
* [SINTEF](http://www.sintef.no/home/)
* [TCD] (http://www.tcd.ie/)
* [Université de Rennes 1](http://www.univ-rennes1.fr/english/)

Other Research
--------------
I'm also interested in complex self-adaptive systems, engineering emergent 
feedback loops, predicting and controlling emergence in humano-tech systems 
(where technical systems interact heavily with human desires/abilities), 
neering robust systems from non-robust parts. If you're interested in 
collaborating, or just want to chat about a specific topic, [get in 
touch]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact.html)!
