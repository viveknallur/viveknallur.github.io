Welcome
=======

I'm Vivek Nallur, itinerant academic, wannabe go-player and an enthusiastic 
traveller. I love asking questions, and then launching on a search for answers 
to those questions. Hence, my career as a researcher came, more or less, 
naturally to me. And I've already lied to you at least twice, in this 
paragraph!

Research
--------
I work as a [Research Fellow]({{ site.baseurl }}/research.html) with the 
[Distributed Systems Group](http://www.dsg.cs.tcd.ie) in the [School of 
Computer Science & Statistics](http://www.scss.tcd.ie) at [Trinity College 
Dublin](http://www.tcd.ie).


Current Project
---------------
I work on an EU project called [Diversify](http://diversify-project.eu) which aims at using 'Diversity' as a foundational principle in making better collaborative adaptive systems. My main interest is in self-adaptive systems, engineering them, predicting/controlling their various properties, getting them to collaborate, and  preventing/boosting emergent effects.
