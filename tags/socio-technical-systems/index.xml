&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tcd.ie/futurecities/&#34;&gt;Future cities research centre&lt;/a&gt; is a multi-disciplinary centre at Trinity College Dublin. Its mission is to
conduct holistic research into all aspects of a smart and sustainable city, and not just view a city as a agglomeration of sensors and people.  It connects
researchers across Trinity, and brings to bear multiple perspectives on the pressing problems of urban living. Typical smart city projects tend to concentrate
on leveraging sensors and the much-vaunted &lt;em&gt;Internet of Things&lt;/em&gt;, to create technical solutions to human problems. We believe that while technology can and should
play an important enabling role in a sustainable future, ultimately the citizens must take responsibility for their city. We investigate projects that can bring
to bear legal policy, urban planning, economic incentives, and educational awareness to nudge citizens towards a healthier and sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;active-areas-of-research:0902b81ceffb0826a9dc92843526137b&#34;&gt;Active Areas of Research&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work on areas such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tcd.ie/futurecities/research/mobility/&#34;&gt;Smart Mobility&lt;/a&gt;: Future Cities&amp;rsquo; Mobility research strand focuses on addressing the effects of increasing road usage including delay, unpredictable journey times, exessive pollution, and driver frustration as well as to improve road safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tcd.ie/futurecities/research/energy/&#34;&gt;Energy Management&lt;/a&gt;: The Future Cities’ Energy research strand focuses on technology development of platforms that enable services for urban energy management. The approaches investigated include forecasting energy demand, improving energy efficiency within the built environment and integrating renewable energy sources into the electrical grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tcd.ie/futurecities/research/pollution/&#34;&gt;Pollution&lt;/a&gt;: The Future Cities’ Pollution research strand looks at improving methodologies for monitoring levels of urban pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tcd.ie/futurecities/research/citizen-engagement/&#34;&gt;Citizen Engagement&lt;/a&gt;: This research strands addresses how citizens can be integrated early in the research pipeline, to ensure that practical considerations are taken into account, highlighting potential negative impact on society (e.g., through weakened privacy and security) and effectively to co-design potential futures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tcd.ie/futurecities/research/urban-scale-data/&#34;&gt;Urban-Scale Data&lt;/a&gt;: This research strand addresses middleware and communications architectures to allow high volumes of data from public, business-owned and user-contributed sensors to be gathered and exploited by smart cities. This area merges wireless sensor networks, vehicular sensor networks, and participatory sensing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Reproducible Results in Software Engineering</title>

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the central problem we face in all of computer science is how we are
to get to the situation where we build on top of the work of others rather
than redoing so much of it in a trivially different way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Richard Hamming (From Turing Award lecture(1968))
&lt;em&gt;Journal of the ACM (Jan 1969), 16, No. 1, 10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;reproducing-and-sharing-results-of-experiments-in-software-engineering:0a02261f8657866700056ef61d86ade2&#34;&gt;Reproducing and Sharing Results of Experiments in Software Engineering&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Hamming&amp;rsquo;s statement has perhaps never been as true, as it is true today. There are literally hundreds of conferences, with tens of thousands of papers published every year. Surely, going by the volume of output, we should be in a much better position with regard to the big problems, than we are at the moment. Of course, there are some problems that are genuinely hard, but even so, a whole lot of effort is expended in trying to do something trivially better or trivially different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that, at least in computer science, there&amp;rsquo;s no value accorded to repeating and verifying experiments. Due to the proliferation of platforms, libraries, languages, the amount of effort involved in reproducing someone else&amp;rsquo;s experiment is so huge that the average researcher doesn&amp;rsquo;t attempt it. If one is unable to reproduce a result, so what? It must be because the environment wasn&amp;rsquo;t just right, or the data-structure wasn&amp;rsquo;t the same as the one in the paper. Or reproducer&amp;rsquo;s code is wrong (even more insidiously, &amp;ldquo;has a bug&amp;rdquo;). The net result is that not many results are reproduced, which of course, then leads to a situation, where published papers have non-reproduceable results! This state of affairs would be unacceptable in any other science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Software Engineering has yet to figure out how to document and preserve forever and ever, the ideas/decisions/assumptions behind a big piece of code, we have reached a point where it is possible to checkpoint a piece of working code and make it available economically to anyone who wants it. Virtual Machines, while cool and dandy, are terribly big and difficult to share. Docker containers, though, in  my opinion, hit a sweet spot where, for certain kinds of code and libraries, the exact configuration and environment can be captured and shared with the world. Thanks to the Docker hub, we can also be reasonably sure that it (the code) won&amp;rsquo;t go away, as soon as researcher moves institutions (To my great mortification and embarrassment, all of my code and data vanished from my PhD student website, soon after I graduated. Which meant that reproducing (and building upon) my TSE paper results was next to impossible).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;docker-hub-address:0a02261f8657866700056ef61d86ade2&#34;&gt;Docker Hub Address&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having learnt my lesson, I&amp;rsquo;m going to put up all of  my paper submissions&amp;rsquo; code
up on Docker Hub in a docker container. So, at the very least, folks can reproduce my results, if not build on it. I&amp;rsquo;m also trying to convince my colleagues to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in complex self-adaptive systems, engineering emergent
feedback loops, predicting and controlling emergence in humano-tech systems
(where technical systems interact heavily with human desires/abilities),
engineering robust systems from non-robust parts.  If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in
collaborating, or just want to chat about a specific topic, &lt;a href=&#34;http://viveknallur.github.io/contact/&#34;&gt;get in
touch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;multi-agent-systems:9ff85ae240172bb97ce520c762b5dcae&#34;&gt;Multi-Agent Systems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are my preferred tool for approaching problems in self-adaptation, complexity, emergence, etc. They lend themselves to extensive
forms of experimentation: having all agents follow simple rules, implementing complex machine-learning algorithms, investigating the interplay of different algorithms
being used at the same time, are all possible with relatively simple conceptual structures. Decoding the end result and teasing out the real factor(s) responsible
for a particular behaviour is considerably more difficult :-). But, that&amp;rsquo;s a part of the fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;decentralized-self-adaptation:9ff85ae240172bb97ce520c762b5dcae&#34;&gt;Decentralized Self-Adaptation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-Adaptation as a concept, has been recognized for a long time, from
biological systems to human affairs. Most natural systems exhibit this
phenomena, viz, the effecting of change by a system to ensure that it continues
to achieve the utility that it previously did. Different self-adaptive systems
exhibit adaptivity in different ways. In human-designed systems, the first
systematic efforts to create a self-adaptive system have been in the domain of
control loop design. Regardless of the type, most systems can be differentiated on the basis on
where the locus of control for self-adaptation lies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centralized&lt;/strong&gt;: In these type of systems, there is usually a hierarchy of
components.
Components at higher levels are responsible for goal management and planning for
change while those at lower levels are responsible for immediate action
and feedback. Decision-making is concentrated in one or a closely related set of
components. Centralized self-adaptive systems exhibit a communication pattern
that is
characterized by sensory information (data) flowing from dumb components to the
central decision maker, and instructions (commands) flowing from the decision
maker
to the dumb components. ‘Dumb’is used here, in the sense of a component having
no awareness of itself and its effects on the environment. Predictable and
cohesive
response to change are advantages of this type of system. However, reaction
times get
slower and slower as the size of the system increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decentralized&lt;/strong&gt;: On the other hand, decentralized systems do not have a
hierarchy of
components. Each component acts as an individual agent with its own goals, and its
own perception of the environment. This has the advantage of quick reaction to change.
But it also has the disadvantage of being fragmented. That is, different components
may react differently to the same change stimulus. This could make the self-adaptation
inefficient or even deleterious. The challenge in building a decentralized
system is to ensure that all the agents collectively move the system towards a common goal. This
is usually accomplished by agents communicating amongst themselves. However, the
lack of a centralized communication pattern means that the communication protocol
must be decentralized and environment-based&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;coin-coordination-organization-institutions-norms:9ff85ae240172bb97ce520c762b5dcae&#34;&gt;COIN: Coordination, Organization, Institutions, Norms&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the particular problems using Multi-Agent Systems, that I&amp;rsquo;m interested in solving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;coordination:9ff85ae240172bb97ce520c762b5dcae&#34;&gt;Coordination&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we create coordination mechanisms for (really) large open distributed systems, which have autonomous components?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guarantee deadlock-freeness, for example&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;organization:9ff85ae240172bb97ce520c762b5dcae&#34;&gt;Organization&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we depend on self-organization to meet system goals?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;institutions:9ff85ae240172bb97ce520c762b5dcae&#34;&gt;Institutions&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What structural patterns are most conducive to emergent institutions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;norms:9ff85ae240172bb97ce520c762b5dcae&#34;&gt;Norms&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we engineer an intelligent socio-technical system such that a self-sustaining/enduring MAS is an emergent property?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can we ensure some form of computational social justice amongst autonomous agents?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** How do we design an intelligent socio-technical system?&lt;/p&gt;
