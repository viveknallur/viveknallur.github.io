      <description>&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;smart cities&lt;/em&gt; gets a lot of play in the tech press and there are many companies that present solutions in this space. But the root cause of the problem isn&amp;rsquo;t
the lack of technology. Rather, it is pressure of population and the scarcity of resources in urban agglomerations, in a future that seems almost as inevitable as climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this dystopian near-future, sustainability is the most important aspect that a wannabe smart city should focus on. And sustainability requires active and enthusiastic
participation from citizens. Instead of focussing on how many objects in a city are &lt;em&gt;connected&lt;/em&gt;, the emphasis should be on disseminating information and knowledge (which is quite a different concept) to
citizens, so that they can participate fruitfully in how their city and life is governed. In my opinion, this is the smartest thing a smart-city could do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, the Indian government announced an &lt;a href=&#34;http://smartcities.gov.in/&#34;&gt;urban renewal and infrastructural development mission&lt;/a&gt; that envisages the creation of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.makeinindia.com/article/-/v/internet-of-things&#34;&gt;100 smart cities&lt;/a&gt;
as a part of a larger agenda of creating an industrial corridor between the existing mega-cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata. While the mission may be ambitious (and laudable)
in terms of providing access to world-class infrastructure, to a large proportion of the population, it would be foolish to expect growth to be smooth and sustainable without explicit
steps taken to ensure that this happens. Depending on city growth to somehow organically result in an increase in the quality of life is a recipe for disaster. Anyone who has
navigated Bangalore traffic knows that unless urban infrastructural problems (and solutions) are measured and scrutinized regularly in an objective manner, there is no hope
of improvement in city life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.janaagraha.org/about-us/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; attempts to provide the first part of the jigsaw, in this regard.
Their &lt;a href=&#34;http://janaagraha.org/reports/ASICS-2015.pdf&#34;&gt;annual survey on city-systems&lt;/a&gt; is a data-rich report with problem evaluation and measurement. Anyone interested
in a bird&amp;rsquo;s eye view of problems, across 21 Indian cities  should take a look. London and New York are included as benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Smoothest Streets in Dublin</title>

&lt;h4 id=&#34;least-bumpy-routing&#34;&gt;Least Bumpy Routing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://viveknallur.github.io/smarthopper/introduction&#34;&gt;SmartHopper&lt;/a&gt; extended to use road smoothness data provided by cyclists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the aims of SmartHopper is to be able to accept any spatial sensor data provided by citizens, and turn it into
useful information. One of our Masters&amp;rsquo; students is an avid cyclist, and he wrote an app that collected smoothness data
from sensors attached to bikes. He then asked his friends to attach sensors and simply use it during their daily rides
through the city. We were able to turn this road-by-road smoothness data into a heatmap and routing information with
minimal effort (took us about 2-3 person days).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the routing that&amp;rsquo;s now made possible, with SmartHopper
&lt;img src=&#34;http://viveknallur.github.io/images/smarthopper/Least_Bumpy_800x600.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Smoothest Cycling Route Through Dublin&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice, that in the visualization, the user can opt to see different layers of road smoothness. And also, SmartHopper simply took
this information, and used it for providing the smoothest (or rather, &amp;ldquo;least bumpy&amp;rdquo;) route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What else can you imagine SmartHopper being extended for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tcd.ie/futurecities/&#34;&gt;Future cities research centre&lt;/a&gt; is a multi-disciplinary centre at Trinity College Dublin. Its mission is to
conduct holistic research into all aspects of a smart and sustainable city, and not just view a city as a agglomeration of sensors and people.  It connects
researchers across Trinity, and brings to bear multiple perspectives on the pressing problems of urban living. Typical smart city projects tend to concentrate
on leveraging sensors and the much-vaunted &lt;em&gt;Internet of Things&lt;/em&gt;, to create technical solutions to human problems. We believe that while technology can and should
play an important enabling role in a sustainable future, ultimately the citizens must take responsibility for their city. We investigate projects that can bring
to bear legal policy, urban planning, economic incentives, and educational awareness to nudge citizens towards a healthier and sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;active-areas-of-research&#34;&gt;Active Areas of Research&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work on areas such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tcd.ie/futurecities/research/mobility/&#34;&gt;Smart Mobility&lt;/a&gt;: Future Cities&amp;rsquo; Mobility research strand focuses on addressing the effects of increasing road usage including delay, unpredictable journey times, exessive pollution, and driver frustration as well as to improve road safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tcd.ie/futurecities/research/energy/&#34;&gt;Energy Management&lt;/a&gt;: The Future Cities’ Energy research strand focuses on technology development of platforms that enable services for urban energy management. The approaches investigated include forecasting energy demand, improving energy efficiency within the built environment and integrating renewable energy sources into the electrical grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tcd.ie/futurecities/research/pollution/&#34;&gt;Pollution&lt;/a&gt;: The Future Cities’ Pollution research strand looks at improving methodologies for monitoring levels of urban pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tcd.ie/futurecities/research/citizen-engagement/&#34;&gt;Citizen Engagement&lt;/a&gt;: This research strands addresses how citizens can be integrated early in the research pipeline, to ensure that practical considerations are taken into account, highlighting potential negative impact on society (e.g., through weakened privacy and security) and effectively to co-design potential futures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tcd.ie/futurecities/research/urban-scale-data/&#34;&gt;Urban-Scale Data&lt;/a&gt;: This research strand addresses middleware and communications architectures to allow high volumes of data from public, business-owned and user-contributed sensors to be gathered and exploited by smart cities. This area merges wireless sensor networks, vehicular sensor networks, and participatory sensing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://viveknallur.github.io/smarthopper/introduction&#34;&gt;SmartHopper&lt;/a&gt; fuses the routing engine, provided by the GraphHopper folks, with the participatory noise data collected by citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what it looks like without the noise data being used:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://viveknallur.github.io/images/smarthopper/Normal-Routing-Without-Noise-800x600.png&#34; alt=&#34;Normal Usage&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, add the noise overlay created from the data uploaded from the smartphones of participating citizens&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://viveknallur.github.io/images/smarthopper/Routing-with-Noise-Overlay-800x600.png&#34; alt=&#34;Noise Overlay&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the menu on the left hand side, change the &lt;em&gt;weighting&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;Least Noisy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since the SETI@Home project took off, the idea of using `crowd power&amp;rsquo; to help out with computing needs has been explored by many projects. The explosion of
the smartphone market opened up a niche in this voluntary computing world. Suddenly, participatory sensing became a means to harness the power of the crowd
in an almost-literal sense.  Given enough enthusiastic participants, researchers could potentially get access to sensor measurements that could be statistically
massaged to get a treasure-trove of GPS-tagged data. However, the excitement of such potential quickly waned as the number of enthusiastic participants dropped with
each additional participatory sensing app, that arrived on the app-market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that more people can be motivated to contribute data to research, if this contribution can be linked to a tangible benefit that citizens can receive
in turn, for volunteering their time and data. &lt;em&gt;SmartHopper&lt;/em&gt; is a smart mobility platform, developed at TCD, that incorporates participatory sensing and combines
it with an open-source routing engine, to enable citizens to generate smarter routes for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;basic-idea&#34;&gt;Basic Idea&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We collaborate with the good folks working on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.noisetube.net/&#34;&gt;NoiseTube Project&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vub.ac.be/&#34;&gt;Vrije Universiteit Brussel&lt;/a&gt; and ask volunteers to walk around Dublin city, so that
we get noise measurements from different streets. Given enough walkers, we are able to generate a &lt;code&gt;Noise Map&lt;/code&gt; of Dublin on a street-by-street basis. Then we transform
this data, and insert it into a Redis store. We also forked the open-source &lt;a href=&#34;http://graphhopper.com/&#34;&gt;GraphHopper&lt;/a&gt; project, to allow it to be deployed and queried
using REST-based API. Now, when you query SmartHopper, it is able to combine a query for a route from (say) Trinity College to (say) Dundrum, with the noise information
gathered from the volunteers and generate the `least noisy&amp;rsquo; route between them. This can be useful for parents with infants, or elderly people wishing to take a walk,
as it enables them to choose a route, that is least affected by noise pollution. For more information about the architecture of the system, check out our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tara.tcd.ie/handle/2262/73955?show=full&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, published
at the Open Source Systems conference. Also, check out the SmartHopper UI page, where you can see screenshots of the system in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;other-ideas&#34;&gt;Other Ideas&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noise is merely an exemplar of what is possible, by combining sensor data with other software. Smarter routes can be enabled, limited only by the availability of data.
We are trying to get air pollution data of several kinds, which can be quite useful for sufferers of pollen allergies, asthma, etc. to generate routes that may
not necessarily be the fastest or the shortest, but are more to their liking. We&amp;rsquo;re looking into tapping into Open Data from any source that is able to generate
consistent and city-wide data, which can then be automatically turned into query-able routes! Smart Mobility is not merely about using technology to find
taxis or public transport, but also being able to query the state-of-the-city, in a personalized manner. If you want to talk to us about data that you have, or ideas
to increase the smartness of SmartHopper, get in &lt;a href=&#34;http://viveknallur.github.io/contact/&#34;&gt;touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;smarthopper-is-now-on-youtube&#34;&gt;SmartHopper is now on Youtube!&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a picture is worth a thousand words, a video is worth, well, a book-chapter
at least. Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scss.tcd.ie/~cardozon/&#34;&gt;Nicolas Cardozo&lt;/a&gt;, from our
group, demonstrating how to use SmartHopper for a whole variety of use-cases. If you don&amp;rsquo;t hear any audio, don&amp;rsquo;t fret. He&amp;rsquo;s the strong and silent type.&lt;/p&gt;
